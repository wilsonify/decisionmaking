struct GeneralizedAdvantageEstimation
    """
    Generalized advantage estimation for computing
both a policy gradient and a value
function gradient for an MDP 𝒫
with initial state distribution b . The
policy is parameterized by θ and
has a log-gradient ∇logπ . The value
function U is parameterized by ϕ
and has a gradient ∇U . This method
runs m rollouts to depth d . The generalized advantage is computed
with exponential weighting λ using
equation (13.21) with a finite horizon. The implementation here is a
simplified version of what was presented in the original paper, which
included aspects of trust regions
when taking steps.
