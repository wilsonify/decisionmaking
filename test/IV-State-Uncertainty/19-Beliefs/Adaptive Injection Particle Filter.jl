"""
A particle filter with adaptive injection, which
maintains fast and slow exponential moving averages w_fast
and w_slow of the mean particle weight with smoothness factors α_fast and α_slow , respectively. Particles are only injected
if the fast moving average of the
mean particle weight is less than
1/ν of the slow moving average.
Recommended values from the
original paper are α_fast = 0.1 ,
α_slow = 0.001 , and ν = 2 .
