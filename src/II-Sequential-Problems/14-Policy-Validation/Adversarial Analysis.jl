"""
Conversion to an
adversarial problem given a policy π . An adversarial agent tries to
change the outcomes of our policy
actions so as to balance minimizing our original utility and maximizing the likelihood of the trajectory. The parameter λ controls
how important it is to maximize
the likelihood of the resulting trajectory. It returns an MDP whose
transition and reward models are
represented as matrices.
