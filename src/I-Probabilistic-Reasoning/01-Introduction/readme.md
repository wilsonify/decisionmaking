This book is divided into five parts.

## I Probabilistic Reasoning

The first part addresses the problem of reasoning about uncertainty and objectives in simple decisions at a single point in time.

## II Sequential Problems

The second part extends decision making to sequential problems, where we must
make a sequence of decisions in response to information about the outcomes of
our actions as we proceed.

## III Model Uncertainty

The third part addresses model uncertainty, where we do not start with a known model and must learn how to act through interaction with the environment. 

## IV State Uncertainty

The fourth part addresses state uncertainty, where imperfect perceptual information prevents us from knowing the full environmental state.

## V Multiagent Systems

The fifth and final part discusses decision contexts involving multiple agents.
