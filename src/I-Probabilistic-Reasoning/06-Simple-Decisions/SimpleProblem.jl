    simple problem as a decision network. 
    A decision network is a Bayesian network with chance, decision, and utility variables. 
    Utility variables are treated as deterministic. 
    Because variables in our Bayesian network take values from 1 : ri , 
    the utility variables are mapped to real values by the utilities field. 
    For example, if we have a utility variable :u1, the ith utility associated with that variable is utilities[:u1][i].
