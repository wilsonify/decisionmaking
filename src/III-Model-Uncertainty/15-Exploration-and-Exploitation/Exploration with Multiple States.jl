The simulation
loop for reinforcement learning
problems. The exploration policy π
generates the next action based on
information in the model and the
current state s . The MDP problem
problem is treated as the ground truth and
is used to sample the next state and
reward. The state transition and reward is used to update the model.
The simulation is run to horizon h .
